# RainBot
A mini Python project that uses the [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-forecast-api/apis/get/forecasts/v1/daily/1day/%7BlocationKey%7D) and [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to text me when it's likely to rain so that I never forget to wear my rain boots :droplet: :hiking_boot: :droplet:
